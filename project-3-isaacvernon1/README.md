# Project 3: Understanding User Behavior

This README.md will start with a description of each of the files in the directory. The description of the project will follow afterwards.

- Project 3.ipynb
    * This is the overall summary of everything I did. Goes through each part of the project, providing highlights and commenting on work. This is where the business questions are answered.
- docker-compose.yml
  * This is the yml file for the project. Provides all images/services used in the project, includes the edits to spark to allow for work to be done in a jupyter notebook.
- game_api.py
  * This is the code for the Web API that will run in Flask.

Set up an app server and create events through Apache Bench. Then, write a streaming process for those events which will publish to HDFS. Finally, make sure that they are available for analysis in Presto.
